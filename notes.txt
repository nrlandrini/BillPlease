3 important files
go res -> layout -> activity_main.xml
go java -> underpackage name -> MainActivity
go manifests -> AndroidManifest.xml (configuration file for activity)

public class MainActivity 

class - template or blueprint
extends - inheritance 

when launching, android will launch the first activity because of the codes 

linearlayout(horizontal) --> in a row
linearLayout(vertical) --> in a column
changing the orientation -> right-click -> convert orientation to vertical (to change to vertical)

wrap_content -> small and short when the button words is long, it follows the word size
match_parent -> to fit the orientation / layout of the screen 

button(child) is written in linearLayout (parent)
thus, the child will follow the parent layout (width) of the match_parent

another attribute 
android:layout_weight="1" - occupies 1/3 of the screen
android:layout_weight="2" - occupies the 2/3 of the screen

if wants half half - both the weight must be the same

setting the height to 0dp do the opposite for horizontal with width
